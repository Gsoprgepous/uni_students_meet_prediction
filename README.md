## Project: **Predicting student Meeting probabilities in University Building 🏫**

## Project Description

**Objectives**

Determining the probability of two students meeting in a building at *different time intervals and locations* (e.g., libraries, lecture halls, cafeterias, etc.).
Suggesting time intervals and areas with the *highest likelihood of student encounters*

**Key Steps**
- Data Collection and Preparation
- Data Analysis and Processing: Group student's schedules by time slots and locations to identify intersection probabilities
- Meeting Probability Prediction: providing time intervals and locations with the highest encounter probabilities
  
**Tools Used**
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy 
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization of results
- SQL for database management
- Git and Jupyter Notebooks for project version control and testing
  
**Example Use Cases ✔🎇**

~ The predicted data can be used by *university/students themselves* to **optimize scheduling** and **improve** student **interactions**

~ For students' personal purposes
